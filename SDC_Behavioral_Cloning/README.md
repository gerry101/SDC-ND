The Project
---
The goals / steps of this project were the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
* Build a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
* Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
* Test that the model successfully drives around the track without leaving the road
* Summarize the results with a written report
